 * isolated and then send it by standard output in the standard .DOT format.
 * Type 'make all & make run' in a terminal to run it.
 *
 * If you prefer, you can plot the graph, redirecting the output to a graphical
 * tool for drawing graphs, like graphviz to see the graph visually, for example:
 * 		make all && make run | dot -Tps -o graph.ps
